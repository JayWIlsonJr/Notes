# A Student's Guid on How to Backbone.js
## Intro

OH HAI! Mason Stewart here. This a "just ok" guide to Backbone.js. It assumes that you're pretty good at computers, but not that you know a lot of bozo comp-sci theory. Monads are cool, but you won't need them for this guide. All I assume is that you at probably have some grasp on how JS constructors work and know the difference between instances and their constructors.


First let's talk about Backbone's four major parts. Most people over complicate Backbone, and most tutorials assume you're some MVC nerd. It's actually much simpler than most people make it. The major parts are:

  * [Models](01-models-and-collections.md)
  * [Collections](01-models-and-collections.md)
  * [Views](02-views.md)
  * Routers

There are a few other parts, but these are the main ones. What's cool about Backbone is that, with a slight exception, all of these parts of Backbone are independent. They don't "require" each other to work and you're free to pick and choose when and if to use any of them.
